# @loozo/fold-ui

Styled Angular components for back-office apps, built on [Origami](../origami-ui/README.md)'s headless primitives and themed with Tailwind CSS v4. fold doesn't ship a component library you import: its schematics copy each component's source into your app, where you own and edit it.

Each fold component is a directive that composes one Origami directive and adds classes. Origami keeps the behavior, accessibility and server rendering; fold adds the look: neutral greys, one green for the primary action, orange only for destructive actions, compact 28, 32 and 36px controls, and dark and light themes.

**Status:** experimental. MIT license. It currently has Button (with ButtonLink) and AlertDialog. There's no loading state, dialog motion, Nx support or way to update a theme you already added.

## Requirements

- An Angular 22 application with Tailwind CSS v4 set up, such as one made by `ng new --style=tailwind`, or after `ng add tailwindcss`. Tested with Angular 22.2.2 and Tailwind CSS 4.3.3.
- Tailwind without a `prefix(...)`: fold's classes are unprefixed.

## Set up

```sh
ng add @loozo/fold-ui
```

`ng add` asks for a selector prefix, `fold` by default (`--prefix acme` for `acmeButton`), then:

1. writes `fold.json` at the workspace root: the prefix and the folder components go into, `<sourceRoot>/ui`. If a `fold.json` already exists, it keeps it and uses its values.
2. creates `<sourceRoot>/ui/theme.css` unless it exists, and imports it right after `@import "tailwindcss"` in your global stylesheet.
3. maps `#ui/*` to the components in your `package.json` `imports`, so you import a component as `#ui/button`. It fails if `#ui/*` already maps somewhere else.
4. adds the packages fold's components use to your dependencies, keeping any you already have: `@loozo/origami-ui`, `tailwind-variants`, `@lucide/angular` (for icons) and `@fontsource-variable/hanken-grotesk` (the font).

`ng add` fails if no global `.css` stylesheet of your build imports Tailwind: run `ng add tailwindcss` first.

`fold.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@loozo/fold-ui/schematics/fold.schema.json",
  "prefix": "fold",
  "path": "src/ui"
}
```

## Add components

```sh
ng generate @loozo/fold-ui:add --names button alert-dialog
```

Without `--names`, it asks which components to add. Each component is a folder under the `fold.json` path, with an `index.ts` that re-exports its parts and one file per part:

```text
src/ui/
├── theme.css
├── cn/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── cn.ts
├── button/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── button-style.ts
│   ├── button.ts
│   └── button-link.ts
└── alert-dialog/
    ├── index.ts
    ├── alert-dialog.ts
    ├── alert-dialog-trigger.ts
    └── …
```

`add` also copies the components a component imports: AlertDialog's Trigger and Cancel are styled by Button's `ButtonStyle`, so adding `alert-dialog` adds `button` too, and every component merges its classes with `cn`, so the first `add` adds `cn`. Components import each other as `../button`.

The files are yours from then on. `add` writes them with your prefix and the Angular CLI formats them with your workspace's Prettier, so `add` can't tell a file you edited from one you didn't. When a named component's folder already exists, `--existing` decides:

- `skip` (default): keep your folder and warn.
- `overwrite`: write fold's files into the folder, replacing those with the same names. Files you added stay.
- `error`: fail before writing anything.

A component that's only a dependency is always kept when its folder exists. To replace it, name it.

## Theming

`theme.css` holds fifteen color tokens, `--radius`, the soft edge shadow `--edge` and the dialog scrim `--scrim`, then maps them to Tailwind with `@theme inline`. Dark is the default theme, on `:root` and `.dark`; a `.light` class swaps every token, for the whole page or for one subtree:

```html
<html class="light"></html>
```

To re-theme, change the token values in your copy; when you add a text size, radius or shadow, also add its name to `cn` (see [Class merging](#class-merging-and-slots)). Hover, pressed and tint colors are mixed from the tokens with `color-mix()`, and the radius ladder derives from `--radius`, so they follow. The theme also adds:

- utilities such as `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-input`, `rounded-control`, `rounded-dialog` and `shadow-edge`.
- a five-step type ladder: `text-display` (28px), `text-headline` (20px), `text-title` (15px), `text-body` (13px) and `text-label` (12px), each with its line height and weight. The body text is 13px, set on `<body>`, so `rem` stays 16px and Tailwind's spacing keeps its sizes.
- `dark:` and `light:` variants that follow the classes instead of the system preference. `dark:` doesn't follow an explicit `.dark` nested inside `.light`.
- the Hanken Grotesk variable font, imported from `@fontsource-variable/hanken-grotesk`.

Tailwind's default colors and `text-*` sizes stay available.

## Class merging and slots

Every part takes a `class` input that's merged over fold's classes, so a conflicting utility of yours wins:

```html
<button foldButton class="px-6">Wider</button>
```

The merging comes from `cn`, a component like the others. `cn/cn.ts` exports `tv`, `tailwind-variants`' variant builder, and `cn(...classes)`, which joins classes and keeps the last of conflicting utilities. Both are configured with the theme's text sizes, radii and shadows, which Tailwind's defaults don't have: without them, `text-title` would count as a text color and cancel `text-foreground`. Use them for your own components too:

```ts
import { Directive, computed, input } from "@angular/core";
import { cn } from "#ui/cn";

@Directive({
  selector: "[appPanel]",
  host: { "[class]": "classes()" },
})
export class Panel {
  readonly class = input("");

  protected readonly classes = computed(() =>
    cn("rounded-surface bg-surface p-4 shadow-popover", this.class()),
  );
}
```

`cn.ts` lists the `--text-*`, `--radius-*` and `--shadow-*` names of `theme.css`. Keep them in sync: when you add one to the theme, add its name to `cn.ts`, or its utilities won't merge with their peers.

Every part sets a `data-slot` attribute, such as `data-slot="button"` or `data-slot="alert-dialog-content"`, to target it from CSS or from a parent's classes, like `[&_[data-slot=button]]:w-full`.

State is styled from the attributes Origami sets: a disabled button has `data-disabled`, so `data-disabled:` and `not-data-disabled:` variants key on it.

## Button

```ts
import { Button, ButtonLink } from "#ui/button";
```

`Button` is a native `<button>` over Origami's [Button](../origami-ui/button/README.md): `type="button"`, plus `disabled` and `focusableWhenDisabled`. `ButtonLink` styles an `<a>` the same way and adds no behavior. Both take:

- `variant`: `primary`, `secondary` (default), `destructive`, `ghost` or `link`.
- `size`: `sm` (28px), `md` (32px, default), `lg` (36px) or `icon` (32px square; give it an `aria-label`).

```html
<button foldButton variant="primary" (click)="save()">Save</button>
<button foldButton variant="ghost" size="icon" aria-label="More actions">
  <svg lucideEllipsis></svg>
</button>
<a foldButton variant="link" href="/contracts">All contracts</a>
```

Use `primary` once per view, on the action the view exists for, and `destructive` only for actions that destroy or end something.

`ButtonStyle` is the selectorless directive behind the look; `buttonVariants` returns the classes for a variant and size. Compose `ButtonStyle` through `hostDirectives` to style your own button-like directive, as AlertDialog's Trigger and Cancel do. One fold button part per element: don't put `foldButton` on an `AlertDialogTrigger`.

## AlertDialog

```ts
import { AlertDialogParts } from "#ui/alert-dialog";
import { Button } from "#ui/button";
```

AlertDialog confirms a destructive action, over Origami's [AlertDialog](../origami-ui/dialog/README.md). `AlertDialogParts` holds all nine parts for a component's `imports`; each is also exported on its own.

```html
<div foldAlertDialog [(open)]="open" [dismissible]="!pending()">
  <button foldAlertDialogTrigger variant="destructive">Terminate contract</button>
  <dialog foldAlertDialogContent>
    <div foldAlertDialogHeader>
      <div foldAlertDialogIcon><svg lucideTriangleAlert></svg></div>
      <h2 foldAlertDialogTitle>Terminate contract LC-2041?</h2>
      <p foldAlertDialogDescription>The final invoice is issued today. This can't be undone.</p>
    </div>
    <div foldAlertDialogFooter>
      <button foldAlertDialogCancel [disabled]="pending()" focusableWhenDisabled>Cancel</button>
      <button
        foldButton
        variant="destructive"
        [disabled]="pending()"
        focusableWhenDisabled
        (click)="terminate()"
      >
        Terminate contract
      </button>
    </div>
  </dialog>
</div>
```

- `AlertDialog`: the root, with `open` (two-way), `dismissible` and `openChange`. It's `display: contents`.
- `AlertDialogTrigger`: opens the dialog. It takes Button's `variant`, `size` and `class`, plus `id`, `disabled` and `focusableWhenDisabled`.
- `AlertDialogContent`: the modal `<dialog>`, up to 440px wide, over a scrim. It takes `id` and `returnFocus`. The backdrop doesn't close it; Escape does while the dialog is dismissible. When it closes, focus returns to the Trigger, or to `returnFocus`.
- `AlertDialogHeader`: lays out the title and description, beside the icon tile when there is one.
- `AlertDialogIcon`: an optional 32px warning tile for an 18px icon, hidden from assistive technology.
- `AlertDialogTitle` and `AlertDialogDescription`: name and describe the dialog for assistive technology. They take `id`.
- `AlertDialogFooter`: the actions, right-aligned.
- `AlertDialogCancel`: closes the dialog and takes initial focus, as the safe choice. Secondary by default; it takes Button's inputs, `disabled` and `focusableWhenDisabled`.

There's no Action part: the action is a `foldButton variant="destructive"` that names the consequence and closes the dialog itself, by setting `open` to `false` when the work succeeds.

While the action is pending, make the dialog non-dismissible and disable both buttons with `focusableWhenDisabled`. A focused button that's natively disabled drops focus to `<body>`, out of the modal; with `focusableWhenDisabled` it stays focused and announces itself as disabled.

A focusable disabled button still dispatches `click`, from a pointer, Enter or Space, so the action's handler returns while pending instead of starting the work again:

```ts
import { finalize } from "rxjs";

// In the component:
protected terminate(): void {
  if (this.pending()) {
    return;
  }

  this.pending.set(true);
  this.contracts
    .terminate(this.contract().id)
    .pipe(finalize(() => this.pending.set(false)))
    .subscribe({
      next: () => this.open.set(false),
      error: () => this.failed.set(true),
    });
}
```

End pending however the work ends: if it fails, the dialog stays open with Cancel, Escape and the action usable again, and can show the error.

## Limitations

- Re-running `add` can't tell untouched files from edited ones, because the CLI reformats them with your Prettier; see `--existing`.
- The dialog scrim is set on `::backdrop`, which needs to inherit custom properties. Chromium and Firefox do; WebKit wasn't tested.
- `tailwind-variants` adds about 13 kB gzipped to your bundle.
- `ng add` adds `imports` at the top of your `package.json`.
- Nx workspaces are untested.

## Developing this package

`components/` holds the component sources the schematics copy, authored with the placeholder prefix `fold__` (`fold__Button`), which `add` replaces with yours. `schematics/` holds `ng-add` and `add`.

```sh
pnpm --filter @loozo/fold-ui test           # typecheck schematics and components, build, schematic tests
pnpm --filter @loozo/fold-ui test:consumer  # ng new → ng add → add → production build → Chromium smoke
```

`test:consumer` needs network access for the app's `npm install`, and runs its build and browser steps under Origami's machine-wide gate lock.
